# Final Project
Hi, this is Patricia Chen. I created this project for [Drawing on the Web](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring20/CSCI-UA.0380-001/)
:art: :computer: 

[Click](http://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~pc2439/drawingtheweb2020/final.html/) to see my final project.

This project is inspired by Taiwan :taiwan:, where I grew up in. 

I decided to do a chibi character walking across Taipei's (Taiwan's capital) cityscape with Taiwanese pop music in the background, a rolling number that displays Taiwan's population, and a cup of boba milk tea being drank as boba has become trendy across the world. 

The index page background is a picture of a town called Pingxi. It is known for the sky lanterns that people fly especially during the Lunar New Year. If you click on the page (anywhere), sky lanterns will appear. The background music is a song called Qi Feng Le, which means Wind in chinese. It is sang by a popular Taiwanese singer, Tsing-Fong Wu. The song is about maturity, hope, and love, which I think fits the scene because it is believed that sky lanterns carry one's wishes and hope. 

The music played for the cityscape is sang by a popular Taiwanese band, Mayday, and the song is called "Starry Night" :milky_way:, which is the reason why there is a starry sky behind the cityscape. You can see Taipei 101 in the cityscape. It was the world's tallest building until 2010, and now stands as the world's 10th tallest building. It is one of the most popular landmarks of Taiwan. The background image is another popular town, Jiufen, known for its old town that hints the culture of Taiwan. 

Taiwan is a small island, but the population is surprisingly high. It is an island surrounded by ocean, which is why the background of the page is a picture of waves. The two traditional chinese characters make up the word Taiwan, and the landscape behind is Taiwan.  

On top of everything, Taiwan is known for its delicious food, especially boba which had gained recognition internationally. So for the third image, I created an animation of a cup of the classic milk tea with boba being drank. :tea:

These are the reasons behind my creation of these three web pages.
