# Final Project
Hi, this is Patricia Chen. I created this project for [Drawing on the Web](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring20/CSCI-UA.0380-001/)

This project is inspired by Taiwan, where I grew up in and am currenrly at. I decided to do a chibi character walking across Taipei's (Taiwan's capital) cityscape with Taiwanese pop music in the background, a rolling number that displays Taiwan's population, and a cup of boba milk tea being drank as boba has become trendy across the world. The music played for the cityscape is sang by a popular Taiwanese band, Mayday, and the song is called "Starry Night", which is the reason behind the starry sky behind the cityscape. Taipei 101 was the world's tallest building until 2010, and now stands as the world's 10th tallest building. It is a popular landmark of Taiwan. Taiwan is a small island, but the population is surprisingly high. Moreover, Taiwan is known for its delicious food, especially boba that had gained recognition internationally. These are the reasons behind my creation of these three web pages.
