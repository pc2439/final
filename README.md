# Final Project
Hi, this is Patricia Chen. I created this project for [Drawing on the Web](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring20/CSCI-UA.0380-001/)

This project is inspired by Taiwan, where I grew up in and am currenrly at. Taiwan is known for its delicious food and for the World's 10th Tallest Building, Taipei 101 (it was the world's tallest building until 2010). Taiwan is a small island, but the population is surprisingly high.
